# Unit Testing

### What is Automated Testing?

The practice of writing code to test our code, and then run those tests in an automated fashion.

#### Automated tests are repeatable!!

### Benefits of Automated Testing

- Test your code frequently, in less time
- Catch the bugs before deploying
- Deploy with confidence
- Refactor with confidence (Refactoring means changing the structure of the code without changing its behavior)
- Focus more on the quality
