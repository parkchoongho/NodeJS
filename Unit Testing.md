# Unit Testing

### What is Automated Testing?

The practice of writing code to test our code, and then run those tests in an automated fashion.

#### Automated tests are repeatable!!

### Benefits of Automated Testing

- Test your code frequently, in less time
- Catch the bugs before deploying
- Deploy with confidence
- Refactor with confidence (Refactoring means changing the structure of the code without changing its behavior)
- Focus more on the quality

### Types of Tests

- Unit Test: Tests a unit of an application **without its external dependencies** 
  - Cheap to write
  - Execute fast
  - Don't give a lot of confidence
- Integration Test: Tests the application **with its external dependencies**
  - Take longer to execute
  - Give more confidence
- End-to-End Test: Drives an application through its UI
  - Give you the greatest confidence
  - Very slow
  - Very brittle
